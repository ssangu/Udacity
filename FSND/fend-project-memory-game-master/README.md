# Memory Game Project

## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Game Functionality

The player flip over cards to locate the pairs that match
    * When cards match, they are displayed in green and locked in match position
    * When cards do not match, they are displayed in red and hidden away face down on the board
    * When all pairs are matched, game finishes and the results are displayed on a modal with
        - number of moves
        - time taken
        - number of stars
        - option to "Play Again"
